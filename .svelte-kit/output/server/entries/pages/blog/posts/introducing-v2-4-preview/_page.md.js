Weâ€™re already seeing the benefits of this transition with faster build times, easier access to APIs and improved performance when navigating between directories. These noticeable improvements are just the start, there a lot additional ways for us to optimize and improve performance. Over the coming months, you can expect us to work on improving startup time and to reduce the amount of system resources being used when the app is open.</p> <h2 id="preview-the-next-version-of-files" data-svelte-h="svelte-14qwnl1">Preview the next version of Files</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-tmm387">In keeping with the spirit of open source, preview builds are currently available with the latest changes and they can be <a href="https://www.files.community/download/preview" rel="nofollow">downloaded</a> from our website.
