a <a${add_attribute("href", "https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nghp3dx8hdx?cid=AnnouncingV2", 0)}>free update</a>
to all our users. Our core mission with Files is to create a modern file manager that pushes the boundaries of the
platform, and with v2, we’ve taken that to a whole new level. We’re excited to share with everyone what we’ve been
working on for the last seven months!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fdebh0">We redesigned the layout of the app, taking advantage of the latest improvements to Windows and WinUI. We added new
features that provide users more flexibility in managing their files, and we made improvements to the stability and
accessibility to allow users to be more productive than ever before.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-32oga3">Files v2 was made possible through the contributions of the open-source community on GitHub. Over the last year, the
number of contributors has more than doubled and we’re incredibly thankful for all their help. There were a couple of
contributors who really went all out and spent a lot of time putting together the update.</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1n0ga6a"><li>Winston de Jong <a href="https://github.com/winston-de"><strong>@winston-de</strong></a></li> <li>Marco Gavelli <a href="https://github.com/gave92"><strong>@gave92</strong></a></li> <li>Martin Anderson <a href="https://github.com/mdtauk"><strong>@mdtauk</strong></a></li> <li>Michael West <a href="https://github.com/itsmichaelwest"><strong>@itsmichaelwest</strong></a></li></ul> <h2 id="new-features" data-svelte-h="svelte-ceo46h">New Features</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7qpn0a">The new features in v2 were designed based off user feedback from more than 4,000 beta users.

the file system.</p> <figure class="margin-bottom" data-svelte-h="svelte-gmsim2"><img src="/blog-resources/filesv2/Files21_V2_ContextMenu_Light_RGB.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the new context menu in Files v2.
