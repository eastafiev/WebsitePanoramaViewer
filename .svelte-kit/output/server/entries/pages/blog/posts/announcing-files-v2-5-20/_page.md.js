Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our <a href="/download/">download page</a>. You can also purchase Files on the <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&amp;cid=FilesWebsite">Microsoft Store</a> as a way to support the project.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h45uou"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This update adds support for pushing Git commits, an improved startup experience, updated toolbar and status icons, support for editing tags from the Details pane, and more.

The Status Bar will display you how many local and remote commits you have, and you can click on it to access the sync, pull, and push options. We hope this feature makes it easier for you to collaborate with other developers and keep your code up to date.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1od422j"><img src="/blog-resources/files2-5-20/GitPush.png" alt="Push commits to remote repos."></figure> <h3 id="improvements-to-the-startup-experience" data-svelte-h="svelte-1x8w5wc">Improvements to the startup experience</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nafcxm">Startup performance is one of our highest priorities and something we‚Äôre working on improving. We‚Äôd like the progress to be faster but unfortunately there are some limitations in the WinAppSdk framework. We hope these limitations will be resolved in future versions of WinAppSdk, but in the meantime, we‚Äôve been working on a lot of smaller optimizations that we hope will add up over time. We‚Äôre also adding a splash screen when the app is opened to indicate that the app is loading.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-8k3tp"><img src="/blog-resources/files2-5-20/SplashScreen.png" alt="Splash screen."></figure> <h3 id="redesigned-layout-icons" data-svelte-h="svelte-41srx6">Redesigned layout icons</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15bmbxg">We redesigned the icons in the layout flyout to be more consistent with the design language in Files.
