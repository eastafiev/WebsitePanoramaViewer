If you already have Files, there should be a notification on the toolbar to install the update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our <a href="/download/">download page</a>. You can also purchase Files on the <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&amp;cid=FilesWebsite">Microsoft Store</a> or sponsor us on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> to help support the project.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1m4uhzc"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Files v3.3 has a refreshed layout picker, additional spacing options for the layouts, more reliable thumbnails, improvements to continue where you left off, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.</p> <h2 id="whats-new-in-v33" data-svelte-h="svelte-q7sj46">What’s new in v3.3</h2> <h3 id="redesigned-layout-picker" data-svelte-h="svelte-eodpza">Redesigned layout picker</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xph220">We refreshed the layout picker with a cleaner and more functional design. The layout options are now displayed in a single row with large buttons, and the selected layout is highlighted using the system accent color.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1tbo1vs">Beneath the the layout section, we added a slider to control the item sizes of the various views including Details, List, Grid, &amp; Columns. Whether you prefer larger or smaller items, there is an option for your personal preference.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-19gs45d"><img src="/blog-resources/v3-3/LayoutPicker.png" alt="Layout picker flyout"></figure> <h3 id="thumbnail-performance-and-dpi-support" data-svelte-h="svelte-5cnl2">Thumbnail performance and DPI support</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-173nxub">In v3.3, we continued working on thumbnail handling. While there is always room for improvement, you can anticipate a more reliable experience with fewer overall issues related to thumbnails.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1beui3f">When a thumbnail takes longer to load, a shimmer animation will be displayed to indicate that the content is loading. Additionally, we added DPI support for icons on the home page, tabs, and left-hand sidebar.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-fed6af"><img src="/blog-resources/v3-3/SidebarIcons.png" alt="DPI aware sidebar icons"></figure> <h3 id="added-a-settings-page-to-manage-layout-preferences" data-svelte-h="svelte-16pq0eh">Added a settings page to manage layout preferences</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ihpt43">We added a new settings page to simplify the management of your layout preferences. These options, formerly nested within submenus on the “Folders” settings page, are now more accessible and easier to locate. Additionally, the “Folders” page was renamed to “Files &amp; folders”.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1c614cl"><img src="/blog-resources/v3-3/LayoutSettings.png" alt="Layout settings page"></figure> <h3 id="continue-where-you-left-off-when-restarting-windows" data-svelte-h="svelte-8mqb99">Continue where you left off when restarting Windows</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yhb41c">Continue where you left off now works when Windows is restarted.
